      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project focused on developing a <strong>Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS)</strong> for an electric go-kart. 
        The system combines a <em>supercapacitor</em> and <em>battery</em> to enhance energy efficiency and power delivery and eventually increase economic feasibility of electric vehicles by reducing battery costs .
        Leveraging advanced control systems and energy management logic, the project addresses key challenges in modern electric vehicle design, including regenerative braking and dynamic load management.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Designed and Implemented a bidirectional DC-DC converter for managing energy flow between the supercapacitor and battery.</li>
        <li>Designed a fuzzy logic-based energy management system for optimizing energy distribution.</li>
        <li>Developed a motor driver and control system for regenerative braking to store energy in the supercapacitor.</li>
        <li>Tested and refined the control system for handling various operational scenarios, such as rapid acceleration and deceleration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical Insights</h2>
      <p>
        The HESS setup leverages the complementary strengths of batteries and supercapacitors. The supercapacitor handles high-power, short-duration demands like acceleration and regenerative braking, while the battery provides sustained energy for longer durations. This hybrid approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prolongs battery life by reducing high-current stress.</li>
        <li>Improves vehicle performance during rapid load changes.</li>
        <li>Maximizes energy recovery during deceleration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges Overcome</h2>
      <p>
        Several challenges were addressed during this project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Directing regenerative energy to the supercapacitor without damaging the battery.</li>
        <li>Ensuring seamless integration of the fuzzy logic controller for real-time energy management.</li>
        <li>Managing voltage spikes in the H-bridge to protect MOSFETs.</li>
      </ul>
